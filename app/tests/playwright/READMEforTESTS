To run the tests, you first need to install Node.js.
You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Then, install Playwright with the following commands:

npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install

To run a specific test file:

npx playwright test tests/playwright/updateTransactionCategory.spec.js

To run all test files at once:

npx playwright test

However, let's not do that just yet. Once the errors are fixed, Iâ€™ll need to adjust the execution order.
